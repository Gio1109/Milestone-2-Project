# Milestone-2-Project


Group 1 MERN Stack for Milestone Project 2

Group Resolution: Create a new template for full-stack course program

Todo: 
    Front-end design- views, controllers
    Back-end design- DB setup


Needed Views:
    Home
    React Hub- R Lessons, R Games, R Tools
    BE Hub- BE Lessons, BE Games, BE Tools
    CS Hub- CS Lessons, CS Games, CS Tools
    Lessons Hub- R Lessons, BE Lessons, CS Lessons
    Games Hub- R Games, BE Games, CS Games
    Tools Hub- R Tools, BE Tools, CS Tools


Needed Functionality:
ability for selected clients to have full CRUD access to database, with a second group having read-only access to admin-selected entities.
EG:
Admin access: Teachers, Course Designers, Etc- Can add or adjust individual lessons, games, tool links, etc
Basic Access: Students, Etc, can Create entities, but any Update functionality is either only for that student's personal view or copy of the entities, with permanent addition to the database relying on admin approval. Specifically avoiding allowing wide-spread full access, but encouraging creativity and open-source learning resources.
